Data Mining project in R

This project is based on the Kaggle competition named Career-Con 2019 - Help Navigate Robots. The competition is a classification task that deals with predicting the type of surface a robot is standing on using data collected from IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors present on the robot. There are 9 different types of surfaces (carpet, concrete, tile, etc.) which the robot was tested on using the sensor data like the orientation, the angular velocity, and the linear acceleration of the robot.
